            The Problem with Conventional Pastes
          </h2>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              When my son was diagnosed with sensory processing challenges, our morning routine became a battle. The foaming, the artificial flavors, the overwhelming textures of conventional toothpaste—it was all too much.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I searched for gentler alternatives, I discovered that many natural options still contained synthetic ingredients, harsh abrasives, or artificial sweeteners. I needed something that honored both his sensitivities and my commitment to clean, purposeful ingredients.

            Returning to Roots
          </h2>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              I remembered my grandmother's stories of traditional tooth powders in India—simple blends of herbs and clays used for centuries. These weren't just remedies; they were rituals of care passed down through generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began researching Ayurvedic oral care practices, studying the properties of neem, clove, turmeric, and bentonite clay. Each ingredient had a purpose, a history, and a gentleness that modern products had lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              After months of formulation and testing with my own family, I created a powder that was effective, gentle, and free from everything we didn't need.

            Building Rooted Smile
          </h2>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-charcoal/80 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Rooted Smile was born from necessity, love, and a deep respect for ancestral wisdom. What started as a solution for my son has grown into a mission to bring clean, intentional oral care to families who value purity and tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every jar is handcrafted in small batches. Every ingredient is chosen with care. Every formula is tested to ensure it delivers the gentle effectiveness that inspired this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't just tooth powder—it's a return to simplicity, a connection to heritage, and a commitment to doing better for our families and our planet.
